    <h1>WHO WE ARE</h1>
    <p>The Indiana University Blockchain & Cryptocurrency Club (IU BCC) aims to explore Blockchain technology and foster an environment of inquisitiveness around and awareness of the technology among the Indiana University community. Cryptocurrencies take a central stage here as these were the first applications of the technology and have become synonymous with Blockchain. However, we hope and seek to delve deeper into the problems and resurface the questions that this technology promises to answer to clear the haze around what makes it so disruptive and think critically to explore its applications in realms both within and outside cryptocurrencies.</p>
